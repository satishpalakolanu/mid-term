        <h2>About Me</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Albert Einstein was a German mathematician and physicist who developed the special and general theories of relativity. In 1921,
       he won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. In the following decade, he immigrated to the 
       United States after being targeted by the German Nazi Party. His work also had a major impact on the development of atomic energy.
       In his later years, Einstein focused on unified field theory. He died in April 1955 at age 76. With his passion for inquiry,
       Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century.

            <p>EINSTEIN: The Man and His Mind gathers photo highlights from the Berger Collection that illustrate chronologically significant moments in Einstein’s life, pairing them with Einstein quotes, signed letters, and biographical notes. The result is a synthesis of personal and professional insights that, when taken as a whole, reveal and profile Einstein’s persona and achievements in a manner that has somehow been missed by the wealth of Einstein books already on the market. 

                An exquisite dance connecting past history with present-day experience is crafted which continues throughout the presentation, allowing modern-day audiences to understand the ongoing relevance and importance of Einstein’s life and times by relating his processes and life to modern experiences.
                
                It cannot be emphasized enough that any library seeking a definitive collection of Einstein information should consider the powerful, well-researched EINSTEIN: The Man and His Mind a ‘foundation pick’ to their holdings.
